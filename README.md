# HelloWorld
HelloWorld is my Hello World project. I will develop this to become my resume where I can track my progress as a learning web developer. 
I will later add css and javascript. So while I am learning I can see the progress of my project as a reflection of my skills.
If anyone wants to help me, feel free to pull and push. Thanks!
