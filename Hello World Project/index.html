        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <br></br>
            <p>I am trying to be a web developer. This is my very first webpage. I will update this webpage as I progress and improve my skills.</p>
            <br></br>
        <h3>
            <p><a href="pages/about.html"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">
                About Me</a></p>
        </h3>
        <br></br>

        <h3>How it's going</h3>
            <ol reversed> <!-- <ol> is ordered list, it automates numbering. If you want to use bullets, use <ul> -->
                <li><a href="#"><i>October 26, 2023.</a></i>
                The webpage looks plain because it's just HTML. I realize it would be fun to add emojis here.</li>
            </ol>    
                <!-- I need to add emojis-->
                <!-- add <li> to add to the list -->
    </body>
