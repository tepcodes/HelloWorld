    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Nice to meet you. I am Josef, an aspiring web developer!</p>
    
    <h2>Motivations</h2>
        <p>I just woke up and beside me is my lovely wife, Juna. I kissed her forehead and greet her, "good morning!"
           <br> I went outside the bedroom, walked outside and greeted all our pet cats, dogs, and maybe some chickens. I am very grateful to a small house with a wide lot area.</br> 
                </p>
        <p>I have always dreamed of the day of owning my own house with a wide backyard where I can live peacfully with my loved ones.
            <br>I realized that if I want to have that dream turn to reality, I need to have a high-demand and high-paying skill. That is why I started to dabble in web development.</br>
                </p>

    <h2>How it started</h2>
        <p>In 2020, our family felt the effect of the pandemic hard. I refused to work in the hospital fearing that I may bring the virus to our house. To keep my parent safe, I tried out
        other jobs that allows for remote work. I quickly learned that in order to land a remote job, I need to have a skill. I tried to capitalize my skill in writing and in 2021 I was given
        an opportunity to be a content creator for a European company. I spent 2 years with that company until 2023.</p>
        <p>While working as a content creator, I was working with the web developer of the company giving suggestions and discussing features that can be added to the website. I had a peak of
            what happens in the background and gained a lot of curiosity of how things are working. 
               </p>
    <h2>How I am learning</h2>
        <p>Soon after, I tried learning on my own by reading articles, doing research on topics, and watching
            YouTube videos but to no avail. I cannot follow the information because I was not following a structured learning. I convinced my fried, who is a web developer himself, to mentor me.
            He gave me resources that I need to read and encouraged me to do my own research about terms I can't understand. I did that for a while but I still cannot digest all those information.
             </p>    
        <p>In July of 2023, my brother got married and I met his friend who was a web developer, too. I asked him to be my mentor and he agreed. He sent me the link to <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">TheOdinProject</a>.
            I am continuing my journey with TOP.
            </p>
        <p>I am also using a pretty fun app, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getmimo&pcampaignid=web_share"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Mimo:Learn to Code</a>. It is a fun app where I am introduced to 
        bite-sized information that is very digestible.
            </p>

    <h2>What I am trying to learn</h2>
        <p>I started trying out phyton. I grasped the very basics until I can no longer follow. Currently, I am learning to develop web pages through the JavaScript path.
